React can be run on browser easily , but the React.createElement syntax quickly becomes heavy , to solve this we use babel , babel can also be run on browser but it is not recomended for production!

Babel: interprets any thing in <script type="text/babel"> using in browser js

JSX : It is powerful , we can use {} to inject js codes

Component : It is a javascript funtion that returns JSX , Use cap case eg : <Header>
