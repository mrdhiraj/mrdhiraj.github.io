<h1>Example: Input for e-mail Address</h1>
<p>A watcher is set up to watch the e-mail input. The user is informed if the current e-mail address input is valid or invalid (missing @).</p>
<p>The user is also informed if the input just became valid with the last input from the keyboard.</p>
<div id="app">
  <label>
    <p>Type a valid e-mail address:</p>
    <input type="email" v-model="inpAddress">
  </label>
  <p v-bind:class="myClass"><code>{{ feedbackText }}</code></p> 
</div>

  <h2>  Watchers vs. Methods</h2>
Watchers and methods are both written as functions, but there are many differences:

Methods are called from HTML.
Methods are often called when an event happens.
Methods automatically receives the event object as an input.
We can also send other values we choose as an input to a method.
Watchers are only called when the watched data property value changes, and this happens automatically.
Watchers automatically receives the new and old value from the watched property.
We cannot choose to send any other values with a watcher as an input.

   <h2> Watchers vs. Computed Properties</h2>
Watchers and computed properties are both written as functions.

Watchers and computed properties are both called automatically when a dependency change, and never called from HTML.

Here are some differences between computed properties and watchers:

Watchers only depend on one property, the property they are set up to watch.
Computed properties can depend on many properties.
Computed properties are used like data properties, except they are dynamic.
Watchers are not referred to from HTML.
